# BackboneJudge.js - a Javascript data validation tool
Judge.js provides means to validate attributes for models, or just generic data. It's not sorcery - the plugin itself only encourages to split validations into separate function without putting all the code in one method. It is especially useful for Backbone validations.
Validating functions have to be written by programmers themselves, although, Judge is shipped with predefined length and presence validating functions.

Judge.js was initially designed as a Backbone.js plugin for models to validate attributes. As the code was universal for any sorts of validations even without Backbone, the plugin was renamed from BackboneCop to Judge.js.
